# Verilog_Basics
Bunch of basic Verilog codes done for practicing.

Firstly did a module, "OR gate with 4 inputs", then instantiated it to "3 stage OR gate for 10 inputs".

After that there was half adder turned to full adder to ripple carry adder for 4 inputs.

Learned how to make muxes in different styles, behavioral and dataflow and then moved on to decoders.
